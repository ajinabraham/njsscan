    message: >
      The Sequelize connection string indicates that TLS certificate vailidation
      of database server is disabled. This is equivalent to not having TLS. An
      attacker can present any invalid certificate and Sequelize will make
      database connection ignoring certificate errors. This setting make the
      connection susceptible to man in the middle (MITM) attacks. Not
      applicable to SQLite database.
